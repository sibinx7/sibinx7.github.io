## Apache and Nginx 

Apache and Nginx are two commonly used server softwares. Apache is bit old and widley used for PHP applications and Shared hostins while Nginx faster than apache in many cases, like static file handling etc.. 

Recenlty  i have a Project which uses Nginx, and my system has onlu Apache, my all WordPress and Laravel application uses this apache. I asked developer to use Apache, but they recommended Nginx, so installed both and use Nginx to server apache websites.
